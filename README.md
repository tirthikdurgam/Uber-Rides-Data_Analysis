## Data Overview

- **Dataset**: Uber ride data containing information such as start and end dates, categories, start and stop locations, mileage, and purposes.
- **Size**: 1,156 rows × 7 columns

---

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Import**: Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values in the 'PURPOSE' column.
   - Convert 'START_DATE' and 'END_DATE' to datetime objects.
   - Extract date and time components.
   - Categorize time into 'Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', and 'Night'.
   - Remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualize distributions of ride categories and purposes.
   - Analyze ride frequencies over different times of the day.
   - Identify top start and stop locations.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to enhance model performance.
5. **Modeling**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees).
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to illustrate findings, such as:

- Bar charts showing the distribution of ride categories.
- Pie charts depicting the purposes of rides.
- Line graphs illustrating ride frequencies over time.
- Heatmaps representing correlations between variables.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate additional datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
- Implement advanced machine learning models for improved predictions.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration.
- Automate data preprocessing and analysis pipelines.
